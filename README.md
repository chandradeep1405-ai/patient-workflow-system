# Patient Workflow System

## Problem Statement
The Patient Workflow System is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of patient management in healthcare settings. The current healthcare system often faces challenges with patient scheduling, information sharing, and coordination among healthcare providers, leading to delays and suboptimal care.

## Solution Approach
Our solution leverages modern technology to streamline the patient journey from admission to treatment and follow-up. By implementing a centralized system, we ensure real-time access to patient data, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions quickly. The system features:
- Online patient scheduling

- A secure platform for accessing and sharing patient information among authorized personnel
- Reporting tools to track patient progress and outcomes

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved patient satisfaction due to reduced wait times and better communication
- Enhanced coordination between healthcare providers
- Reduction in administrative overhead for managing patient workflows
- Data-driven insights for continuous improvements in patient care

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project.
- `resources/`: Contains any supplementary resources, such as images or datasets.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Conclusion
The Patient Workflow System aims to revolutionize the way healthcare providers manage patient workflows, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery.
